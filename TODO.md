1. ## one big module script instead of many small ones
2. ## Pester Testing if vms are up is not a real pester test (Code testing Only)
3. ## Different types of terminal information in the GUI. (Detailed, medium, simple)
4. ## Documentation in multiple .md files for code explaining. Also specify where AI was used
5. ## port fields in the GUI (some servers/PCs my not use the same standard port for remote protocols)
6. ## better os detection, if port is 5985(WinRM) OS is defenetly Windows. Or powershell script to retrieve information of the os with both connections (ssh, WinRM)
